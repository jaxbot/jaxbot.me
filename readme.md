The software that runs **societyofcode.com**, my personal website. Codenamed "Medli".

It's experimental, but I wanted something that would make my site less of a blog and more of a place, a place where I could just put stuff for people to see, with no implication that it will update in a timely fashion.

I'm not 100% happy, or even 90% happy with the overall code, but I tried to keep it simple, and I think I managed that.
